# June 2nd: Got started!

Got started on my next project today, wanted to create something new and cool after my hackpad. Did lots of planning today for what I wanted to make. Decided I wanted to create:
  -  a smart badge all on one PCB with a lanyard cutout which I could wear to my next hackathon
  -  something similar to github's badger as shown below:
  -  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c322ed44-18c8-444e-a7cf-f4d542586ab7)
  -  an e-ink display for maximum battery life so it doesnt have to be charged, making it more convenient for long events
  -  a small lipo battery with proper charging circuit so it doesnt blow up
  -  usb C connectivity to make charging a breeze with a modern connector
  -  RP2040 integrated powering the display as this is a small but powerful enough chip
  -  ability to easily program the RP2040 to change the display details, could integrate this with the USB C port?
  -  all should be able to be created with JLCPCB's PCBA for easiest assembly

Feeling happy with the concept so far, excited to see how I could integrate this all onto one cleanly designed PCB. I think it'll be a great learning journey, especially with integrating my own RP2040 chips into a dev breakout board of my own as I have never done this before.
